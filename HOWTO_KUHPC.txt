HOWTO run Resummino in batch on KU HPC.

1. cd $WORK                                # (You should now be in /panfs/pfs.local/work/wilson/$USER)
2. mkdir ResumminoOut                      # for job output 
3. git clone https://github.com/grahamwwilson/ResumminoHPC.git   # code base
4. mkdir Resummino_Launch                  # for launch script and job logs
5. cd Resummino_Launch
6. cp $WORK/ResumminoHPC/launch-N2C1.sh .    # Starting example 
7. Edit the underlying script (ResumminoHPC/run-N2C1.sh) so that it does not send ME E-mail
8 ./launch-N2C1.sh                           # This submits the basic script (ResumminoHPC/run-N2C1.sh) to the batch system
